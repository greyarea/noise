Description: Perlin noise is ubiquitous in modern CGI. Used for procedural texturing,
	animation, and enhancing realism, Perlin noise has been called the "salt" of
	procedural content. Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise, smoothly
	interpolating across a pseudo-random matrix of values.

	The noise library includes native-code implementations of Perlin "improved"
	noise and Perlin simplex noise. It also includes a fast implementation of
	Perlin noise in GLSL, for use in OpenGL shaders. The shader code and many of
	the included examples require Pyglet (http://www.pyglet.org), the native-code
	noise functions themselves do not, however.

	The Perlin improved noise functions can also generate fBm (fractal Brownian
	motion) noise by combining multiple octaves of Perlin noise. Functions for
	convenient generation of turbulent noise are also included.
